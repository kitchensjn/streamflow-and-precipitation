# Streamflow and Precipitation

This GitHub repository goes along with this [blog post](https://james-kitchens.com/blog/streamflow-and-precipitation/) on my personal website.

I am interested in looking at how precipitation across a river basin affects streamflow at the gauge stations.

The main file, streamflow-and-precipitation.R, includes the code used to create images for the post.
