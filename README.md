# Streamflow and Precipitation

The USGS has developed streamflow prediction models for many large rivers, including the James River through Richmond, Virginia:

These forecasted levels are very important to local recreational kayakers as the characteristics of the river change with its height. I wanted to develop my own methods for predicting river level based on public data sources and expand these methods to streams that do not currently have forecasted values.
